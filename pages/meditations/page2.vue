        To get the most out of your meditation practice, it's essential to create a peaceful environment. Choose a quiet and comfortable space where you won't be disturbed. Consider using a cushion or chair for added comfort. Soft lighting and calming d√©cor can help set the right atmosphere. Your meditation space should be a sanctuary that invites tranquility and focus.
